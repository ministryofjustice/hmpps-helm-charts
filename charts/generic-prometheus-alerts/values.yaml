# Alert by default will target resources uses a regex and the application name (.Values.targetApplication).
# To be more or less specific with promql queries set these overrides in the parent chart, examples:

# podTargetOverride: ".*"

# deploymentTargetOverride: ".*"

# ingressTargetOverride: ".*"

# hpaTargetOverride: ".*"

# jobTargetOverride: ".*"

# cronjobTargetOverride: ".*"

# Mod_Security normally blocks requests with http status 403 - forbidden.
# To be able to distinguish and specifically alert on mod_security blocking
# the general pattern has been to update the mod_security config to block
# using a different status code. The default is 406 but this can be overridden:Â 

# modSecBlockingStatusCodeOverride: "406"
